**Instant WEBP Converter** is a Streamlit app allowing you to quickly convert your images to the WEBP format.
The main advantage of this app over online converters is that it keeps your images private.
Unlike online converters that upload your images to a remote server, Instant WEBP Converter performs all conversions locally.

## **Why Use Instant WEBP Converter?**
When using online image converters, your images are typically uploaded to a remote server for conversion.
Although these services often claim to delete your images within 24 hours, there's no guarantee that your images will remain private.

Instant WEBP Converter solves this problem by performing all conversions locally. 
When you upload an image, the app converts the image to a base64 string, which is converted to the WEBP format.
This process ensures that your images never leave your local machine.

In addition to providing privacy, converting your images to the WEBP format can significantly reduce their size.
In fact, you can expect to reduce the size of your images by up to 75% without any loss in quality.
This reduction in size is crucial for improving web page speeds, making Instant WEBP Converter an essential tool for web developers.

## **How to Use Instant WEBP Converter**
Using Instant WEBP Converter is easy. Upload your images using the file uploader, and the app will automatically convert them to the WEBP format.
You can then download the converted images directly from the app.
